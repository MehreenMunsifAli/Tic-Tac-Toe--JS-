# Tic Tac Toe


 Logic:

* Create 2D array for winning patterns
* Access each box 
* Event listener whenever a box is clicked
* Disable box so that it cannot be clicked again
* Check winner and show winner with a message if conditions are met
* If checkWinner() conditions are not true and click count becomes 9, the game will draw. Show a different message in this condition.
* 'New Game' and 'Reset Game' buttons have a callback function 'resetGame()' 
* 'New Game' button will only appear with the message. 'Reset Game' can be clicked any time to restart the game.
* To reset game, (1) all boxes have to be enabled to click again, (2) count should be 0, (3) turn O should be true.
